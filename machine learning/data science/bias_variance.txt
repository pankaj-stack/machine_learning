Overfitting:
-----------
>model is performing well on training set but poor with testing set
>it means model is not regularized or generalized.

why:
>too many features.

Underfitting:
------------
>model is not performing well even with training set
>it means model is again not generalized

why:
>lack of features


Bias and Variance:
------------------
> it is a technique that tells about overfitting or underfitting situations in the model.

Training set accuracy:98%
Testing set accuracy:80%

result:
	overfitting:low bias and high variance

Training set accuracy:82%
Testing set accuracy:80%

result:
	underfitting:high bias and low variance

Note:low variance means model is generalized or regularized

Training set accuracy:80%
Testing set accuracy:60%

result:
	underfitting:high bias and high variance

Training set accuracy:98%
Testing set accuracy:95%

result:
	just right:low bias and low variance



Training ----->80%
Testing------->98%

bias-->high
variance---high

Underfitting
